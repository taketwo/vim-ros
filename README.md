This plugin activates itself only for files within a (rosbuild-style) ROS
package.

Features
========

* Sets `&makeprg` to `catkin_make` or `rosmake <package-name>` so that the
package, to which the file being edited belongs, could be built with `:make`.
* Adds commands:
  - `:A` to alternate between _.cpp_ and _.h_ files in the current package
  - `:Roscd` to cd to an arbitrary ROS package (with tab-completion)
  - `:Rosed` to open arbitrary files (with tab-completion of both package and
    filenames)
  - `:TabRosed` to `:Rosed` into a new tab

Message, service, and action files
----------------------------------

Adds minimal support for `.msg`, `.srv`, and `.action` files:
  - filetype detection
  - syntax highlighting
  - omni-completion for message types
  - goto message definition with 'gd' command

Launch files
------------

Adds minimal support for `.launch` files:
  - filetype detection
  - syntax highlighting (xml)
  - syntax check (if [Syntastic][] is available)
  - omni-completion for package types
  - goto file with 'gf' command (when the cursor is on a tag with 'filename'
    attribute)

Installation
============

I recommend installing `vim-ros` using [pathogen][] or [Vundle][].
